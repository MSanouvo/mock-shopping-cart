# Mock Shopping Cart

A mock storefront (project courtest of The Odin Project) utilizing React to emulate adding/removing items from a digital shopping cart.

Upon opening the page, users are greeted to a welcome message on a Home page describing what they can do. At the top of the navbar are 3 links that direct users to the home page, store page, and cart page respectively. Adding an item to the cart from the store page will add that item and it's set count to the shopping cart where it will be displayed on the cart page with the option to delete it. Duplicate items will simply increase the count rather than add a new instance of the item to the cart. The "complete transaction" button on the cart page is purely cosmetic and has no set functionality.

While the overall product of this project is rather simple, a majority of the time was spent learning to write tests using React Testing Library. Compared to other projects where I might just start writing code and figuring out things as I went, I took a step back from that approach to plan out most of what I wanted to write beforehand, having tests in mind that would confirm my desired outcome for my components. Additionally, this was my first time using React Router to link to separate pages so this project served as a good opportunity to learn and play with these new tools. The products on display were taken from <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com/">Fake store API</a>.

This is still a basic version of a digital storefront and there is more to be done that could make it feel more in line with actual stores. Aside from improving the style of the page, I'd like to polish it with more products and item details (price, reviews, etc) as well as add more depth to the cart with a count total and total price. I'd also like to add dropdown features for the cart icon to see a simplified version before going to a dedicated cart page and improve some of the UI throughout the experience.
